What is the difference between precision and recall?
What is cross-validation, and why is it important in binary classification?
Answers:-

1A) Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive cases out of all cases predicted as positive. In other words, it tells us how many of the predicted positives were actually correct.

Recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive cases out of all actual positive cases in the dataset. It indicates how well the model is able to capture all relevant positive instances. Recall becomes crucial when missing positive cases has a high cost, like in medical diagnosis

2A) Cross-validation is a robust model evaluation technique that helps assess how well a machine learning model generalizes to new, unseen data. The most common form is k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds. The model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold, repeating this process k times so that each fold serves as the test set once.

In binary classification, cross-validation plays a critical role in preventing overfitting, particularly when the dataset is small or imbalanced. A single train-test split might not accurately reflect the modelâ€™s ability to identify minority class instances, which are often the most important in binary tasks like fraud detection or disease diagnosis. Cross-validation ensures that the model is evaluated on multiple different subsets of data, providing a more comprehensive understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. It also aids in selecting the best model and tuning hyperparameters with greater confidence, making it a vital tool for building robust and trustworthy classification systems.
